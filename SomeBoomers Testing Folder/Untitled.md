Despite his rather unsettling appearance and disheartening reputation for ruthless pragmatism towards the enemies of House Omni and whispers of his secret mastery of magical manipulation, most people can't help but feel sympathy and even full fledged trust and friendship towards the High Inquisitor and Director of the Foreign Ministry, Omnibert the Wanderer.

His mangled body and painful looking posture (The result of an extended period in a rival House's dungeons more than half a century ago) don't seem to affect his cognition and wit in the slightest and his empathy, patience and dedication to House Omni are legendary. 

Always accompanied by at least a handful of his white ravens, who's eyes display uncanny intellect, Omnibert is often traveling the lands to ensure House Omni's grip on power is unwavering, but while at Court he never refuses to lend a patient ear, encouraging words or helpful advice.

Some whisper that the Omnarch's trust in Omibert is bordering on recklessness and that the Wanderer might secretly harbor more selfish ambition than he lets on, but these rumors are obviously muttered by people with nefarious goals.
