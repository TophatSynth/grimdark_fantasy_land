## Overview:

Also known as "The Black Ward". An order of Knights, thrust into the ever-shifting landscape of [[The Mirror]] during the [[The Great Calamity|Calamity]]. They still inhabit what's left of their former keep, the structure anchored in relative stability by ancient, yet slowly waning wards. 

They cling to existence and self-preservation despite the inevitability of being consumed and changed beyond recognition in the end. This forces them to adapt. They zealously rely on protocol, dogma and traditions.

Physically they embrace, in very ritualized ways, the inevitable change. Slowly, in calculated doses to minimize risk, neophytes are exposed to the mutating reality that is ever-present for the order.

Occurring changes are closely monitored: There is a set number of mutations which are accepted and even intended. But members that show signs of moral corruption, degradation and risk of turning on their brothers and sisters are swiftly, mercilessly and without fault executed by fire. 

These cullings are not cruel, but necessary to ensure the order's survival. Not only neophytes are subject to constant scrutiny, but even revered Hunters up until the Lord Commander are closely monitored by the collective. The cleansing flame waits for all those who fall from grace. The Ward must endure.

Centuries of exposure to *The Mirror* and embracing it's effects have taken a irreversible toll on the order: They are forever incapable of fully, permanently returning to whats left of Reality, forever bound to accept *The Mirror* as their home.

## Protection, Tribute and Raids:

*The Ward*, despite appearing barely Human to those who lay eyes on them, still need the resources, any human society needs. Food, water, ore, manpower. All of these can not reliably be found in *The Mirror*.

To compensate, *The Ward* has taken to combine resource-collection with finding purpose beyond mere existence. They might not be able to permanently return to reality, but they **can** cross [[The Veil]] temporarily. These excursions aim to:
- Fight for Humanity against the mirror-born horrors
- Collect tribute in form of resources and neophytes from communities The Ward has under protection
- Ensure communities uphold *The Ward*'s moral and ethic dogmas concerning beings from the mirror:
	- Malevolent horrors must be culled
	- Neutral entities must be **observed** and evaluated, not put to blade and pire without trial
	- Benevolent beings (Yes those also exist) must be spared. *The Ward* themselves are partially mirror-born by now and thus view a select group of those as allies or at least helpful enough to warrant protection.
- Communities that are openly antagonistic towards *The Ward*, refuse to pay tribute, or slaughter mirror-born without distinguishing good from evil, are sure to pay the price.
