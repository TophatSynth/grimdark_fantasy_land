# Overview:

An ancient order of Knights, thrust into the ever-shifting landscape of [[The Mirror]] centuries ago, during the [[The Great Calamity|Calamity]]. They still inhabit what is left of their former keep, The Hearth, the crumbling structure anchored in relative stability by ancient, yet slowly waning wards. 

The Ward clings to existence and self-preservation despite the inevitability of being consumed and changed beyond recognition in the end. This forced them to adapt their traditions long ago. They zealously rely on these protocols, dogmas and their existence hinges on them. 

Physically they embrace, in very ritualized, controlled ways, the inevitable change. Slowly, in calculated doses to minimize risk, neophytes (The Proselytes) are exposed to the mutating reality that is ever-present for the conclave.

Occurring changes are closely monitored and members, not only proselytes, that show signs of moral corruption, degradation and risk of turning on their brothers and sisters are swiftly, mercilessly and without fault executed by fire. 

These cullings of individuals and even entire groups are not cruel, but necessary to ensure the conclaves's survival. Not only proselytes are subject to constant scrutiny, but even revered Hunters up until the Lord Commander are closely monitored by the collective. The cleansing flame waits for all those who fall from grace. The Ward must endure.

Centuries of exposure to *The Mirror* and embracing it's effects have, in addition to twisting and mutating them beyond recognition, taken an irreversible toll on the order: They are forever incapable of fully, permanently returning to whats left of Reality. 

Any incursion lead by the Ward are limited to a few days at most, the Wardens quickly weakening, fading, draining away. So, for better or worse, they are forever bound to accept *The Mirror* as their home.

# Goals of the Conclave:
<br>
## Hunts & Crusades in Reality:

*The Ward*, despite appearing barely Human to those who lay eyes on them, still need the resources, any human society needs. Food, water, ore, timber, manpower. All of these can not reliably be found in *The Mirror*.

To compensate, *The Ward* has taken to combine resource-collection with finding purpose beyond mere existence and enduring. They might not be able to permanently return to reality, but they **can** cross [[The Veil]] temporarily.

These excursions aim to:
- Gain insight and information about the state of (and time passed in) Reality
- Fight for Humanity against the mirror-born horrors
- Collect tribute in form of resources and proselytes from communities under their protection
- Ensure communities uphold *The Ward*'s moral and ethic dogmas
- Communities that are openly antagonistic towards *The Ward*, refuse to pay tribute, or slaughter mirror-born without evaluation, are sure to pay the price.

# Worldview and Principles:


> [!Quote] Lord Librarian Duncan Farsight<br>127 AC
> "We may be Custodians of Humanity in a sea of Darkness, but we are also hunters. Predators fighting our way to the top"


- Survival of the Ward exceeds all. Principle, honor, friendship and compassion shall flicker and perish before the Hearth falls to corruption.
<br>
- The Ward is your tribe, your Band are your family. You die for both.
<br>
- Hunting has clear rules. The Ward does not devolve into butchers or mindless berserks.
	- Every Hunt, quest and crusade is proceeded by preparation and planning
	- Potential targets get evaluated and classified
	- Killing is ritualized, swift and decisive
	- Unneeded cruelty towards monsters and men is shunned
<br>
- Mirror-born entities are not a monstrous mass, they come in gradients:
	- True Horrors
	- Unstable Entities
	- Sentient Others
<br>
- Hunting is not a sport, it is:
	- Training for survival
	- Ritualistic anchoring
	- Controlled exposure to the Mirror
	- Proof of mastery
- Only True Horrors are fair game, Unstable Entities require evaluation, Sentient Others are off limits.
- The only time when protocol can be foregone is during surprise attacks, when The Great Hall is under threat or similar situations.
<br>
- Corruption and betrayal must be rooted out by any means
- Brotherhood, bonds, the past, the Hearth... nothing matters in the face of erasure

# Order Structure, Traditions and Hierarchy:
<br>
## Titles, Ranks & Naming Conventions (Please suggest improvements!):

- Lord Commander - Military Leader
- Lord Librarian - Spiritual Leader
<br>
- The Ward - The entirety of the Conclave, the overarching web that holds it in existance, with the Lords in the Center and the Bands uniformly spread out.

- The Band (The Cell?, The Pack?, The Kin?) - The smallest and closest unit of Wardens. Typically comprised of 4-8 members

- The Lattice acts as 
	- Ensures that Cells are periodically reassigned roles, routes and routines (Prevents stagnation, ensures flexibility and reduces possible corruption)
	- Cells are regularly deployed in unison with brethren Cells to increase cooperation, bonding and cross-cell corruption-recognition

## Rules & Traditions

- The 



### The Rules of Severance:

- The Succouring:
	- Periodically, but never predictably, Wardens are temporary reassigned to a different Hearth for various reasons (Lend specific talents, Increase manpower, share experience)

- The Parting:
	- In the instance of unrest, unsolvable disagreements, risk of infighting, extraordinary need for a specific Warden in a different Pack etc, one or more members of a Band may at any point be reappointed to a different Band. This is rare, tragic and only done when absolutely necessary 

- 4-8 Wardens form a Cell
	- Trained Together
	- Mutations compliment each other
	- One cohesive unit. More like Family than Comrades
	-
