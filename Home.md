# Notes here:

## TechSavvySynth's Notes:
- Need to read up on all the lore so far, then re-organise them so it's a lil clearer
- Use bases to make TOC 

## BoomerNoiza's Notes:

- Could this be a placeholder Map for a smallish area to work on as a sandbox?
- If yes: Should I edit it to have three mayor settlements (Gives us a nice, smallish sandbox)
	- Ideas for these Towns:
	- 1. Mining town sitting atop a mountain pass. Mostly producing ore, metal, tools and weapons
	- 2. Farming/Agricultural Town in the heart of the valley. Mostly producing food
	- 3. Harbor/Fishing Town by the ocean. Mostly producing seafood and hub for some trade

- Races/Species: Should we have multiple actual distinct races or stick with Humans and "Humans plus"? I love fantasy race tropes, but at the same time I feel like having only humanity would help keep the setting grounded and real in its weirdness

- Would like an Alchemy-System
