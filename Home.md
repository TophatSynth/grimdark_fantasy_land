## Notes here:

## TechSavvySynth's Notes:
- Need to read up on all the lore so far, then re-organise them so it's a lil clearer
- Use bases to make TOC 
- Thoughts on using tags to denote the to do list? something like #todo 
	- ^ allows me to integrate it into bases so we can have a list of things we need to address

## BoomerNoiza's Notes:

- To get Leaflet working:
	- Get the Leaflet Plugin + Enable it.
	- I will handle maps if that is alright for you

- Ideas for the Sandbox/Brainstorm Area:
	- 1. Mining town sitting atop a mountain pass. Mostly producing ore, metal, tools and weapons
	- 2. Farming/Agricultural Town in the heart of the valley. Mostly producing food
	- 3. Harbor/Fishing Town by the ocean. Mostly producing seafood and hub for some trade
	- 4. Fortified Inns along the roads (The chain broken and Inns varying widely in architecture and state of repair)
	- "The Paladins" (Name pending) have a smallish keep in the area
	- There is at least one Thin-veiled area in the valley, allowing the "Predators" easy access

- Races/Species: Should we have multiple actual distinct races or stick with Humans and "Humans plus"? I love fantasy race tropes, but at the same time I feel like having only humanity would help keep the setting grounded and real in its weirdness

- Would like an Alchemy-System
