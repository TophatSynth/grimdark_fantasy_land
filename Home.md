# Notes here:

## TechSavvySynth's Notes:
- Need to read up on all the lore so far, then re-organise them so it's a lil clearer
- Use bases to make TOC 

## BoomerNoiza's Notes:

- ~~Could this be a placeholder Map for a smallish area to work on as a sandbox?~~
- Will edit it to have three mayor settlements (Gives us a nice, smallish sandbox)
- Races/Species: Should we have multiple actual distinct races or stick with Humans and "Humans plus"? I love fantasy race tropes, but at the same time I feel like having only humanity would help keep the setting grounded and real in its weirdness
- Would like an Alchemy-System
