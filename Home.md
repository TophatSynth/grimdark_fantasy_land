## Notes here:

## TechSavvySynth's Notes:
- Need to read up on all the lore so far, then re-organise them so it's a lil clearer
 - [x] Use bases to make TOC 
	- [ ] Show number of todo tags per file?
- Work on alchemy 
- Spirit fragment types need thinking
- Add my fireflower idea to [[Ironkeep (Name Placeholder)]]

## BoomerNoiza's Notes:


> [!WARNING|no-t] Title
> The "Publish"-Frontmatter is used for Quartz-publishing shenanigans


- [x] Moved the Map to its correct Note and created a bunch of blank notes by accident.
- [x] Continued obsessing over the Wardens

- Would like an Alchemy-System (Tophead hard at work - Nice!)

- Flora & Fauna: Should we go full fantastical or use real world animals at least to keep things grounded (and less work)?
	- TH: {I'd say go with what we did for Vilenought. Real world animals, corrupted by the veil}
		- MN: {{I agree. Easier for immersion and less Exposition also}}



- Ideas to add for the Sandbox/Brainstorm Area:
	- Fortified Inns along the roads (The chain broken and Inns varying widely in architecture and state of repair)
	- "The Paladins" (Name pending) have a smallish keep in the area
	- There is at least one Thin-veiled area in the valley, allowing the "Predators" easy access
