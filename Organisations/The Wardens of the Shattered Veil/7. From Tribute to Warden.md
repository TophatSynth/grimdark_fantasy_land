# The Process of Binding

Potential Novices get taken in typically when they are around 12 years old

## Naming conventions

Any potential future Warden is stripped of their family names upon becoming part of the Ward. 

During the first parts of training they are addressed as Unrisen (Name pending), their name only being used sparingly.

Only upon successfully completing their Tempering Hunt, the Novices officially earn the title of Risen (Name pending) and are considered members of the Ward, albeit not full members yet.
