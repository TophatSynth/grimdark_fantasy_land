# Overview

The Wardbearer is a Band's guide through the twisted, ever-changing Wilderness of the *Mirror*. It is the Wardbearer that can sense the location of thin-veiled areas. It is them who posses the means and mastery to tear open the *Veil* and guide their Kin into Reality.

The Wardbearer is also the one responsible for securing, as much as that is possible in the Mirror, the Band's campsites with minor wards, circles and incense. Without the Wardbearer the Band is stranded in a sea of terror. A jungle that wants nothing more then to strangle and twist them. For as fierce as the [[2.4. The Hunters|Hunter]] fights, all Wardens can fight. None but the Wardbearer can guide them home. And all to often they pay a terrible price for their service.

## Mandatory Weaves:

These Weaves *must* be mastered on at least a basic level by every potential Wardbearer. Inability to do so does not necessarily result in *Erasure* but bars this path from the *Unbound* in question.

##### **Piercing the Veil**
This incantation is the means for the Wardens to cross the Veil and enter Reality. It is this Weave, and it alone, that allows the Ward to endure, to repair, rearm, restock and replenish their ranks. For this reason, even among the 3 sanctioned Weaves, it is the first and most important.
