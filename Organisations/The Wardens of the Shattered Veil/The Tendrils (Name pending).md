# Overview

The knightly order now known as [[Organisations/The Wardens of the Shattered Veil/The Wardens of the Shattered Veil|The Wardens of the Shattered Veil]] has long ago started to slowly, painstakingly expand their territory and foothold in [[The Mirror]].

Although knowledge of how the ancients created almost indefinitely lasting wards is long forgotten and most of the powerful runestones still in existence are used to protect [[The Hearth]],  the most proficient [[Wardbearers]] of the order have found ways to make due. Their creations might not last as long and the barriers erected are not as strong, but they suffice to claw back areas of [[The Wilds]].

These footholds are commonly knows as *The Tendrils* by the Ward and serve as Watchtowers, logistic checkpoints and to establish controlled areas for [[Veil-Brea hes]] in thin-veiled zones.
