# The Quiet Watch - Observation, Surveillance, Evaluation & Judgment

- The Watch
	- A covert observation assignment to a Watcher by The Quiet
	- Always masked as, and in conjunction with a regular Succouring or a Stewardship transferral
	- Documents missteps, alarming behavior, tenant-oversteps in general
	- Files reports and delivers them to The Quiet

- The Watchers
	- Any eligible Warden temporarily assigned by The Quiet to conduct a Watch
	- Always anonymous, only The Quiet knows who is currently Watcher
	- Having undergone past Evaluations prohibits a Warden from ever being a Watcher

- The Witnesses
	- Only in extremely rare cases, mostly when the Jury can not decide between a Parting and a Sundering, the Quiet reveal the identity of the Wacher that filed a report
	- The Watcher then becomes a Witness and speaks before the Jury

- The Quiet
	- A collective of Mutes. Tasked with anonymizing Watch-reports, delivering them to the Jury and revealing Identity of the Scrutinized only after a guilty charge is cast.
	- Also randomly chooses Bands to undergo a Watching, assigns Watchers and coordinates Watches with scheduled Succourings or Stewardships
	- Chooses and assigns Black Bonds to carry out the execution of Judgements
	- The Muted are ritual components integral to the execution of the Watch system, not an independent body of power.

- The Jury
	- Seventeen randomly chosen Wardens that get summoned by the Quiet whenever a Watch has ended
	- Each Jury only meets once in the same constellation and only decides on one Judging
	- Any Warden eligible for duty as Watcher is also eligible as Judge

### The Judgements:

- The Marking
	- A Warden that has been evaluated and only a very minor infraction has been detected, the individual is considered Marked
	- Markings are always anonymous and only the Quiet track them to a name
	- The Warden in question is not informed
	- If a Marked gains a second Mark at any time, the sentence is automatically at least Parting

- The Parting
	- Social and structural severance for one specific Warden
	- Forced, permanent reassignment to another Band to sever unhealthy ties, prevent infighting and shatter budding rebellion

- The Sundering
	- Social and structural severance for an entire Band
	- The Band is permanently disbanded and its members are each assigned to a different Band

- The Muting
	- The Warden is stripped of all his ranks, powers and identity
	- Tongue removal and partial lobotomy
	- The Muted serves in The Quiet for life

- The Erasure
	- Execution by fire. Can apply to individuals or entire Bands.
