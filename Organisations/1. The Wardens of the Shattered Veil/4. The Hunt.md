The Hunt is not an act of glory, nor a calling born of zeal.  
It is the discipline by which the Ward endures, the burden laid upon it to stand guard at the precipice.

Every blade drawn, every arrow loosed, every flame kindled is a measured answer to a hostile world that never rests, never seizes its attempts to drag humanity into darkness. 

To refuse the Hunt is to invite extinction. To hunt without doctrine is to descend into slaughter, to become mere butchers.

The Ward does neither.

The Hunt encompasses all sanctioned acts of force and armed excursions undertaken by the Ward - whether against the mirror-born, the corrupted, or Humanity itself when doctrine demands it. Tracking, culling, warding, crusade, reprisal, protection and extermination.

Whether in the Wilds of the Mirror or beyond the Veil, to hunt is to expose oneself to the Mirror, to invite change, and to risk becoming what must be destroyed.

For these reasons, The Hunt is bound by law older than any living Warden.

See [[4. The Hunt]] for details about the *Doctrine of the Hunt*

## The Hunt - Laws & Classifications
<br>

The Hunt exists not for sport, not for glory, nor for conquest.

It serves four functions, and four alone:

- To protect the Ward, the Hearth and its Tendrils
    
- To shield Humanity from the encroaching ruin and thin the horrors pressing against the Veil
    
- To temper Wardens through controlled exposure
    
- To prove mastery over fear, blade and self
    
Every Hunt teaches restraint as much as violence. Every return is an accounting.

## Doctrine of the Hunt

###### I. The Hunt is restrained
The Ward does not butcher or rage, nor does it kill without cause. Blind violence gnaws at the foundations we stand on. A Warden who kills for pleasure or convenience has failed the Ward, even if the prey lies dead. Indulgence in blood brings us close to becoming what we vowed to erase.
<br>

###### II. The Hunt observes
Potential targets are named, measured, and weighed against doctrine before a drop of blood is shed. To rush blindly is to risk slaying the innocent.
Ignorance does not carry absolution.
<br>

###### III. The Hunt is prepared
Every Hunt is preceded by preparation, divination, and deliberation.
Rituals are carried out, not only for tradition’s sake, but to steady the Wardens’ minds against erosion.
No prey is pursued without deliberation. No ground is entered blindly. To rush is to invite failure and corruption.
<br>

###### IV. The Hunt does not linger
When observation, preparation and deliberation have concluded, the Hunt is decisive. 
Killing, when sanctioned, is swift.
Cruelty beyond necessity is taboo. Prolonged violence feeds the Mirror. Lingering cruelty invites change. indulgence in suffering erodes empathy and judgement. Empathy and judgment make us what we are.
<br>

###### V. The Hunt is Humble
A Warden does not revel in the afterglow of a Hunt, nor does a Warden boast.
To kill is to learn. To learn is to grow. A prideful Warden will soon be forgotten.
<br>

###### VI. When the Doctrine Breaks
There are moments when law bends or shatters. Surprise incursions, breaches of the Hearth, overwhelming assaults from the Wilds.

In such moments, survival eclipses tradition. 

But these exceptions are never forgotten.
<br>

###### VII. The Hunt is Assessed 
When the fires die and the wounded are counted, the Hunt is reviewed. Actions taken in necessity are weighed after the fact, and necessity does not grant immunity from judgement.

The Ward endures not because it is flawless - but because it remembers.

### The Measure of the Prey

Not all things born of the Mirror are equal. To pretend otherwise is ignorance - and ignorance is lethal.

All encountered entities are classified before sanction:

- **True Horrors**  
Abominations beyond redemption and irredeemably hostile to Humanity and the Ward.
Their existence is a constant wound upon Reality.
No quarter is given. No evaluation delays the blade. Their destruction is mandatory and requires no further sanction.


- **Unstable Entities**  
Creatures or beings showing fluctuation in morals, partial or full sentience, unclear motives or are simply not clearly cataloged. 
Action requires evaluation. Rash judgment is forbidden.
They must be observed, tested, and judged. To strike too soon risks murder. To hesitate too long risks death.

- **Sentient Others**  
Self-aware beings capable of reason, memory, and restraint. By doctrine, they are not prey.  
The Ward protects this boundary fiercely, for the day it is crossed without sanction is the day the Hunt becomes slaughter.
To hunt them without sanction is itself an Unhallowed Act.
<br>

Misclassification is a grave offense. To kill what should have been spared invites scrutiny. To spare what should have been culled invites worse.
