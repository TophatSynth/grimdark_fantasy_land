## Roles Within a Band

- All are Wardens are combat/hunt capable. These are functional specializations

- Accolades and Accomplishments within a role do **not** officially bring increased authority, but inofficially and in the field the experienced and revered Wardens are often held in high regards even if they currently do not act as Bandmaster

### The Roles:

### Leadership & Composition

Given the need to form strong bonds within Bands and thus, forging them when the Wardens are young, often long before their *Binding Hunt*, exact composition varies. A few rules must always be followed:

- No Band ever counts more than 8 or less than 4 Wardens
- Every Band must at least include one Warden of each role
- In the event of a Parting, Muting or Erasure occurring or a Warden fading, the Band only gets a new member assigned in case only 3 Wardens would be left or a role would be unfilled.
- Leadership within a Band is rotating among the Wardens. Before each Hunt, it is evaluated and voted upon, who's expertise best fits the requirements.
