# Overview:

An ancient order of Knights, thrust into the ever-shifting landscape of The Mirror centuries ago, during the Calamity. They still inhabit what is left of their former keep, The Hearth, the crumbling structure anchored in relative stability by ancient, yet slowly waning wards.

The Order clings to existence and self-preservation despite the inevitability of being consumed and changed beyond recognition in the end. This forced them to adapt their traditions long ago. They zealously rely on these protocols and dogmas, and their existence hinges on them.

Physically they embrace, in very ritualized, controlled ways, the inevitable change. Slowly, in calculated doses to minimize risk, neophytes (The Proselytes) are exposed to the mutating reality that is ever-present for the conclave.

Occurring changes are closely monitored and members, not only proselytes, that show signs of moral corruption, degradation, and risk of turning on their brothers and sisters are swiftly, mercilessly, and without fault executed by fire.

These cullings of individuals and even entire groups are not cruel, but necessary to ensure the conclave’s survival. Not only proselytes are subject to constant scrutiny, but even revered Hunters up until the Lord Commander are closely monitored by the collective. The cleansing flame waits for all those who fall from grace. The Ward must endure.

Centuries of exposure to The Mirror and embracing its effects have, in addition to twisting and mutating them beyond recognition, taken an irreversible toll on the order: they are forever incapable of fully, permanently returning to what is left of Reality.

Any incursion led by the Ward is limited to a few days at most, the Wardens quickly weakening, fading, draining away. So, for better or worse, they are forever bound to accept The Mirror as their home.

## The Tenets – Core Doctrinal Concepts and Principles

These are at the very core of the Warden’s existence. Forged and refined over centuries, they are a distillation of the contradicting foundation the Ward is built upon.

Lord Librarian Duncan Farsight, 127 AC  
“We may be Custodians of Humanity in a sea of Darkness, but we are also hunters. Predators fighting our way to the top.”

I. Survival of the Ward exceeds all. Our commitment to its continued existence is absolute. Brotherhood, honor, friendship, and compassion shall turn to dust before the Hearth falls to corruption.

II. Cherish your Kin, trust them with your life. But never trust blindly. For tomorrow a Black Bond might come.

III. The Ward is your tribe, your Band is your family. You will gladly die for both.

IV. Know your Kin like you know yourself. Celebrate with them, mourn the faded. Uphold the Memory.

V. Uphold the Ember that burns in your heart. For the Light shall guide your path; it shall shine bright in the face of the Horror. It shall flicker and die when the cleansing flames consume your soul.

VI. Embrace the change, for it makes you strong. Watch out for corruption, in yourself and in your Kin.

VII. The day a Black Bond comes for our brothers and sisters, or ourselves, we shall lay down our arms and repent. For it is on us to see the seeds of corruption taking root.

VIII. The Hunt is the charge laid upon us, the path that was appointed. We shall not falter, for we are the true Custodians, standing between humanity and the horrors creeping in the dark.

## The Hunt

Attributed to the First Wardens:  
“The Mirror hunts us without pause.  
To survive, we learned to hunt it back.”

The Hunt is not an act of glory, nor a calling born of zeal. It is the discipline by which the Ward endures, the burden laid upon it to stand guard at the precipice.

Every blade drawn, every arrow loosed, every flame kindled is a measured answer to a hostile world that never rests, never ceases its attempts to drag humanity into darkness.

To refuse the Hunt is to invite extinction. To hunt without doctrine is to descend into slaughter, to become mere butchers.

The Ward does neither.

The Hunt encompasses all sanctioned acts of force and armed excursions undertaken by the Ward, whether against the mirror-born, the corrupted, or humanity itself when doctrine demands it. Tracking, culling, warding, crusade, reprisal, protection, and extermination.

Whether in the Wilds of the Mirror or beyond the Veil, to hunt is to expose oneself to the Mirror, to invite change, and to risk becoming what must be destroyed.

For these reasons, the Hunt is bound by law older than any living Warden.

See 4. The Hunt for details about the Doctrine of the Hunt.

### Hunts and Crusades in Reality:

The Ward, despite appearing barely human to those who lay eyes on them, still needs the resources any human society needs: food, water, ore, timber, manpower. All of these cannot reliably be found in The Mirror.

To compensate, the Ward has taken to combining resource collection with finding purpose beyond mere existence and enduring. They might not be able to permanently return to reality, but they can cross the Veil temporarily.

These excursions aim to:  
Gain insight and information about the state of, and time passed in, Reality  
Fight for humanity against the mirror-born horrors  
Collect tribute in the form of resources and proselytes from communities under their protection  
Ensure communities uphold the Ward’s moral and ethical dogmas  
Communities that are openly antagonistic towards the Ward, refuse to pay tribute, or slaughter mirror-born without evaluation are sure to pay the price.

Order Structure, Traditions, Naming Conventions, and Hierarchy (please suggest improvements):

I. The Order Itself

The Ward  
The entirety of the order, the collective body, doctrine, and survival mechanism.

The Black Web  
The concept describing the overarching structure that holds it in existence, with the Lords in the center and the Bands uniformly spread out, no part stronger than the weakest link.

The Conclave  
Used interchangeably with the Ward to emphasize its ruling, doctrinal, and ritual aspect.

The Hearth  
The headquarters and keep of the Ward, anchored in relative stability within the Mirror.

The Mirror  
The hostile, mutable realm that is now the Ward’s permanent home.

The Veil  
The boundary between Reality and the Mirror.

The Wilds  
The entirety of the Mirror outside of the Ward’s permanent realm of control.

II. Members and Status

Warden  
Full, initialized members of the Ward. All members of the Ward are Wardens, from rank and file up to the Lord Commander.

Kin  
Meaning interchangeable with “Warden,” but used more often in private, unofficial contexts.

The Unrisen / The Unbound  
Initiates and proselytes undergoing controlled exposure and awaiting final evaluation.  
Observe, bear the marks, serve and get bound, so you may rise one day.

Cubs / Fledglings  
Unofficial naming convention for freshly risen or bound that have passed their final evaluation.

The Quiet  
Wardens sentenced to the Muting: tongueless, depowered, partially lobotomized. Used as warning and ultimate punishment, and tasked with anonymizing reports filed by Watchers, issuing randomized Watchings, and revealing the names of the Watched after the Jury has issued a guilt sentence.

III. Organizational Units

The Band (name pending)  
Smallest and closest operational and social unit, four to eight Wardens.  
Alternative names in circulation as slang: cell, pack, unit.  
Trained and bound together mostly for life, except for succourings, partings, and sunderings.  
Mutations complement each other.  
One cohesive unit, more like family than comrades.  
See 2. The Band for more details.

The Stewards  
Not a dedicated organization but a role.  
Any Band can be transferred to stewardship at any time.  
Not a punishment but part of the standard transferring cycle.  
Tasked with securing the Hearth, daily chores, and assisting the leadership.

The Bond  
Two or more Bands working together for a predetermined amount of time and towards a set goal.

The Black Bond  
Two or more Bands assigned with executing a judgment towards an individual Warden or a Band.  
Also known as the Ashwardens.

IV. Hierarchy and Titles (names pending)

High Authority

Lord Commander  
Military leader of the Ward.

Lord Librarian  
Spiritual, doctrinal, and ideological authority.

High Wardens  
Very few in number, senior figures such as hunters, stewards, and warriors.  
Coordinate Ward Marshals.

Command and Coordination

Ward Marshals  
Coordinate multiple Bands; oversee succourings, bondings, transferrings, and general deployment and logistics.

Bandmasters  
Tactical leaders of a Band, final authority in the field.  
Not a permanent position; rotates according to Hunt requirements.

VI. Rules and Traditions

Severance and Unity – Internal Transfers, Routine Mechanisms, and Social Control

The Succouring  
Temporary reassignment of Wardens between Bands.  
Used to bolster unit strength, lend specific talents, share experience, and similar reasons.  
Always communicated to the Quiet in case a Watching is planned.

The Transferring  
Periodic and mandatory reassignment of roles, routes, and routines of entire cells.  
Prevents stagnation, ensures flexibility, and reduces possible corruption.

The Bonding  
Joint deployments of multiple Bands to reinforce cooperation, cohesion, cross-unit bonding, and cross-observation.

The Stewardship  
Any Band can be transferred to stewardship at any time.  
Not a punishment but part of the standard transferring cycle.  
Tasked with securing the Hearth, daily chores, and assisting the leadership.

The Joy  
Bands are actively encouraged to develop traditions, rituals, and patterns that suit every member, strengthen unity, and bolster morale.  
Wardens may openly show quirks and be individually distinctive.  
These freedoms end without compromise where they undermine Ward traditions, collective unity, or invite corruption.

The Self  
Wardens on an individual level may and should pursue goals, ambitions, and passions that bring satisfaction and validation. Most often these manifest as martial prowess, meditation, and other obviously beneficial skills for daily life in the Mirror. Some Wardens also paint, draw, sculpt, write, debate, and engage in other activities that seem less beneficial. The true reason the Self is part of the doctrine is that it keeps the horrors of the mind at bay and grounds the Wardens in a glimpse of reality, of a life they will never know.

The Quiet Watch – Observation, Surveillance, Evaluation, and Judgment

The Watch  
A covert observation assignment to a Watcher by the Quiet.  
Always masked as and conducted in conjunction with a regular succouring or stewardship transfer.  
Documents missteps, alarming behavior, and tenet oversteps in general.  
Files reports and delivers them to the Quiet.

The Watchers  
Any eligible Warden temporarily assigned by the Quiet to conduct a Watch.  
Always anonymous; only the Quiet knows who is currently a Watcher.  
Having undergone past evaluations prohibits a Warden from ever being a Watcher.

The Witnesses  
Only in extremely rare cases, mostly when the Jury cannot decide between a Parting and a Sundering, the Quiet reveal the identity of the Watcher that filed a report.  
The Watcher then becomes a Witness and speaks before the Jury.

The Quiet  
A collective of mutes tasked with anonymizing Watch reports, delivering them to the Jury, and revealing the identity of the scrutinized only after a guilty charge is cast.  
Also randomly chooses Bands to undergo a Watching, assigns Watchers, and coordinates Watches with scheduled succourings or stewardships.  
Chooses and assigns Black Bonds to carry out the execution of judgments.  
The Muted are ritual components integral to the execution of the Watch system, not an independent body of power.

The Jury  
Seventeen randomly chosen Wardens summoned by the Quiet whenever a Watch has ended.  
Each Jury meets only once in the same constellation and decides only one judging.  
Any Warden eligible for duty as Watcher is also eligible as Judge.

The Unhallowed Acts – Major Misconducts and Boundaries

Breaking of tenets and doctrine  
Detrimental change  
Stagnation  
Corruption  
Loyalty shifts  
Scheming  
Lying  
And more

The Judgments

The Marking  
A Warden evaluated with only a very minor infraction detected is considered Marked.  
Markings are always anonymous and only the Quiet track them to a name.  
The Warden is not informed.  
If a Marked gains a second Mark at any time, the sentence is automatically at least Parting.

The Parting  
Social and structural severance for one specific Warden.  
Forced, permanent reassignment to another Band to sever unhealthy ties, prevent infighting, and shatter budding rebellion.

The Sundering  
Social and structural severance for an entire Band.  
The Band is permanently disbanded and its members are each assigned to a different Band.

The Muting  
The Warden is stripped of all ranks, powers, and identity.  
Tongue removal and partial lobotomy.  
The Muted serves in the Quiet for life.

The Erasure  
Execution by fire. Can apply to individuals or entire Bands.

---

The Execution

Carried out by the Black Bonds.  
Black Bonds are not permanent executioners but are assigned by the Quiet on a per-judgment basis.  
Chosen randomly by the Quiet and always at least two Bands strong.
