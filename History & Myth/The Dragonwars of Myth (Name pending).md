#ToDecide #todo 

Legends say, that in ancient times, before [[The Great Calamity]], the great Human empires fought an endless war with a race of powerful, dragon-riding humanoids. Very little is known about these events, even less so about the origins or motives of the Dragonriders. It may well be entirely myth and legend.

But scholars and brave adventures far and wide, now and then, manage to uncover strange ruins, bones that appear to have turned to stone, bones of giant creatures, some seem like they had wings. So maybe like so often, the myth contains a kernel of truth.

And maybe, just maybe, somewhere out there, across the sea, these terrifying creatures still roam.
