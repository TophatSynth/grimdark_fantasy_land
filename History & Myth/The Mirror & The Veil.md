## Overview
<br>
To formulate words to accurately and cleanly describe the Mirror is a futile attempt. No description or scholarly journal can encompass the vast, ever-shifting landscape beyond the Veil.

Every mountain, every valley, every town and every lake, every river, every village, every forest and desert has a twisted, contorted, but distinct representation in the Mirror.
