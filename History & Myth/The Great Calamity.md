# Overview

The Great Calamity was an apocalyptic event that occurred roughly ten thousand years ago. The exact series of events is shrouded in mystery and maybe only the [[Organisations/1. The Wardens of the Shattered Veil/1. Overview|Wardens of the Shattered Veil]] and the [[Organisations/2. {The Order of the cleansing Flame}/1. Overview|Order of the cleansing Flame]] still remember what truly led to this catastrophe that wiped out the ancient empires of men and left nothing but dust, rubble, creeping shadows and death.

Most scholars tend to agree, that before the collapse, Humanity had achieved it all. Power, Dominance, Prosperity, Advancements in technology and humanities. Abolishment of poverty and hunger. Wondrous marvels of engineering brought wealth, stability, safety to all.

What happened then is less conclusive. The leading theory is, that the ever expanding reliance on Magic, on the all-powerful Weavers of old, led to the downfall. It is said that all Magic, no matter how small and fickle, draws it's power from the terrible [[The Mirror & The Veil|Mirror]]. By relying more and more on this power, by drawing more and ever more from it, the *Mirror* was pulled ever closer, the Barrier being stretched ever thinner.

There must have been early signs. Warnings of what was to come. The *Veil* must have teared in places, the Horrors must have made their presence known. Most likely the hubris and power of humanity reacted in kind. Attempting to use Weavings to counteract the events. Most likely this worked for a while. Most likely they even truly believed to be in control. 

But then the Veil ruptured. Not locally. Not partially. The Mirror crashed into Reality. It brought Horrors, pain, suffering, death and destruction. It ended an era. And, lingering to this day, it brought the *Fracture*.
