# Below are the (slightly cleaned up) mechanics from Vilenought:

## Basic Concept:

- New attribute: **Essence Attunement** (EA)
    - (IQ + HT)/2
    - 10 CP/lvl
    - Governs “Essence Reserve” (At default ER = EA, Can be bought up for 3 CP, up to 30% over EA, Can *not* be bought down)
    - Governs available “Weaving-Talent”-lvls
    - EA 10-11: “Weaving-Talent” 1, EA 12-13: “Weaving-Talent” 2, EA 14-15: “Weaving-Talent” 3 and so on
<br>
- **Essence Reserve** & HP:
    - Spells can only be paid for with ER and HP, _not_ with regular FP!
    - ER recharges at 1/hour (Slow Recharge, -20%)
    - Recharge can be increased by meditation
    - Increase by: (Meditation-Level/10)*2
        - Minimum of 1
        - Round any decimals
<br>
- **Spells are Powers and Skills**:
	- Each Spell is build as a Power with mandatory Enhancements/Limitations
    - Each spell requires a casting roll against an **Aspect Skill** and, if relevant, a second roll **to attack** (Innate attack).
    - Each Aspect Skill is a (VH) EA skill that defaults to EA-based Thaumatology-5
    - A defaulted Aspect Skill cannot be higher than 15
    - If a spell belongs to multiple aspects, then the caster rolls against all of those Aspect Skills.
    - Aspect Skill Rolls are modified by the Weaving-Talent level
<br>
- **Weaving Talents**:
    - Each Discipline is represented by a _Talent_ (Essentially replacing Magery)
    - Each Talent costs **5 CP/Level**
    - Talent lvl gives a bonus on associated **Aspect-skill Rolls**
    - Talent lvl gives a bonus on learning/creating associated Spells
    - Talent level is capped by EA
<br>

## Weaving Empowerment:

- Cost: Pending
    
- Each discipline of magic has its own Weaving Empowerment
    
- All spells are **Alternative Abilities**, based on their governing Weaving Empowerment
    
- Cost of spells, excluding “Alternative Ability” can not exceed cost of Weaving Empowerment
    
- Learning an “Empowerment” unlocks **very** basic spells on lvl 1 **for free** (List pending)
<br>
- **Temporary Preparation:**
    
    - Uses weaving empowerment **level** to determine which spells can be prepared.
    - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
    - Requires 1 hour of preparation/memorization
    - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
    - Once prepared, the weaving is treated as “known” and can be cast normally until "overwritten" 
        
- **Desperate Preperation:**
    
    - Uses **total CP** spend on (Instead of Level in) “Weaving Empowerment” to determine which spells can be prepared
    - Also requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
    - Also requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
    - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
    - Once prepared, the weaver has a **single** casting of the spell ready
    - ?_Desperately_ prepared spells lead to increased “Essence Residue”-buildup in the weaver (raised by two (2) levels)?
        
- **Preperation-Slots:**
    
    - For each instance of Weaving Empowerment **one** (1) spell may be (desperately) prepared
        
    - Additional instances of Weaving Empowerment may be bought
        
    - Each prep-slot **only** allows preperation of spells from its type of magic
<br>
## Aspect-Skill-roll to cast:

- One Roll on each corresponding Aspect-Skill (modified by Weaving-Talent) in order of usage in casting
- Spontaneous enhancements of known spells (Damage, Range, Duration, etc)
- Spontaneous modification of casting parameters (Time spend, Energy spend, Rituals used, etc)
- Penalties can be balanced out by spending more FP/HP and/or adjusting the casting parameters
	- See Spell modification - On the fly for details
- Spells can be modified in a more stable, prepared manner too
	- See Spell modification - Stable for details
<br>
## Acquiring new Spells:

- Only known styles/aspects can be used for spell construction
- Only when logically sound, can a new spell be constructed without outside help
- E.g. Fireball might need Matter, Heat and Pressure & Knowledge of “Create Fire” and “Gust” (Many routes might be feasible)
- Only exception: Learning from detailed written accounts or teachers
- Spell (Power) cost (after “Alternative Ability-Limitation”) can not exceed points in “Weaving Empowerment”
<br>
## [Backlash:](https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Backlash)
- Weaving magic **always** carries the risk of backfiring
- By default **every** spell has *Backlash, Variable* (Priced like [Costs Fatigue, Variable](https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Costs_Fatigue,_Variable))
- Each school/discipline of magic has its own dedicated backlash table
- After every weaving, the caster rolls on **all** associated Backlash-Tables. The roll is modified by FP spend, so more powerful weavings risk more extreme backlashes
- The roll is further modified if the weaving-roll was a failure
<br>
## [Attracts Threats:](https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Power-Ups_8:_Limitations)
- Weaving magic **always** carries the risk of attracting unwanted attention
<br>
## [Radically Unstable Magery](https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Radically_Unstable_Magery)
- Every spell is a great risk of catastrophic failure.
- It is mandatory for every spell-power to have *Radically unstable Magery, -10%*
