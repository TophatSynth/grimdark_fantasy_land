- General idea: Reality has a negative imprint in a parallel dimension (think the warp but less openly antagonistic. More like the warp before the chaos gods where born, but then again, less tranquil and more dangerous than that)

- Tone inspired by the Witcher and Brothers Grimm, with ideas from Warhammer Fantasy, Vilenought and The first law universe sprinkled in.

- Civilization is mostly, if not fully, confined to heavily fortified towns, villages and Hamlets. There are no huge empires (Or maybe there is a crumbling one, slowly fading to obscurity) but only smaller kingdoms and city states.

- Outside of the settlements, the wilderness is a dialed to eleven version of the Witcher and Warhammer worlds. Monsters and beasts are roaming and supernatural creatures are very common. Here the brother's Grimm inspirations also are visible in locations, characters and threats.

- The only respites are heavily fortified inns, similar to those in the empire in WH fantasy. They are situated 50 to 100 kilometers from each other along the crumbling remnants of trade roads and offer rest, services and most importantly, bonfires (or magical lights, not sure yet) to alarm the next inns of imminent danger.

- Farming and agriculture is mostly confined to the "Enlightened zone" around settlements, areas that are heavily guarded and often deforested to minimize risk. The fields are only worked during the day and livestock is expensive and rare.

- "The Mirror", the parallel dimension is responsible for: Magic in the world, Mutations in the population, Mirrorborn beasts and monsters. All these are more common in areas where the Veil is thin.
