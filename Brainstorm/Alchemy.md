- 2 types
	- Spirit alchemy
		- Less powerful, but safer in general
			- Generally has more of a naturalism vibe in terms of effects 
			- Think witch in the woods, bringing out the properties of certain substances 
		- Requires going to certain places related to the effect desired
		- Ingredients are very difficult to obtain — the first leaf of fall, a dozen virgin toads
		- Chants are specific and obscure 
		- BUT — anybody can do them, if they found all the necessary components 
		- Maybe the act of alchemy provides them an anchor with which to affect the world, but in doing so also binds them, preventing the spirits from dispelling it themselves
	- Mirror alchemy
		- Can also be done by anyone 
		- Still requires difficult ingredients
		- More powerful, but requires the user to go to [[Veil-Scarring (Or Essence Weaving)|veil-scarred]] places -> runs the risk of mutations and etc
- Another idea is to have alchemy be the in-between of mirror and spirit 
	- The alchemy does not really produce the effect, but rather attracts the right spirit for the job so to speak? #ToDecide 	
- Leads to a lot of superstition on certain items having intrinsic properties that, with the right ritual, can be brought out
	- eg silver laid in a bucket under the full moon will bring you protection
	-  the trick being some is true, some isn't
