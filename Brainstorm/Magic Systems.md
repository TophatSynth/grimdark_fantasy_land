# Overview

## Spirit Magic:
- Mostly (If not only) known and used in the wilderness of the Northern Expanse
- Has generally two Subcategories: **Spirit Communing** and **Spirit Absorption**
- Can generally **not** be learnt. One can or can not use it.
- It is important to note, that [[Elder Spirits]] and [[Spirit Fragments]] do **not** originate from the [[The Mirror|Mirror]], but the [[The Spirit Realm|Spirit Realm]] of reality
<br>
### Spirit Communing:
- Simply said, one invites nearby [[Elder Spirits]] to their camp.
- The less civilized/tainted/tamed the wilderness is, the more likely one or in rare instances, multiple spirits show up.
- Generally, beeing of elevated mind (Smoking mushrooms or herbs, Consuming strong liquor, etc) greatly increases the chance for contact
- The more (non-medium) people are present, the less likely a contact is to happen
- These [[Elder Spirits]] are a weird bunch. They appear mostly sentient, albeit not comparable to Humans. They generally couldn't care much less about worldly issues. They also have a very different sense of time and scale/distance to worldly beings. What most of them share is a great sadness, as the Spirits are slowly fading. Most times a Medium will at most get some vague hints or very open for interpretation statements and a long winded (yet often pleasant) philosophical debate.
<br>
### Spirit Absorption:
- [[Spirit Fragments]], in contrast to [[Elder Spirits]] are generally not viewed as sentient, at least of not in any way we can identify.
- This Practice sees the user absorb a wild spirit fragment into their body to gain specific benefits for a relatively short amount of time and wirth certain drawbacks.
- The known types of Spirit Fragments are:
	- Fire
	- Water
	- Death
	- Air
	- Rott
	- (More to come)

## Spirit Bargains:

## Veil Scarring:
- Lefover knowledge from aeons ago, before the [[Calamity]]. Extremely rare and dangerous these days
- Uses a modified version of our Vilenought-Magic System
- There will be **no** hardcore improvisation + improvisation. There will be however, temporary enhancements of spells (added damage, range, area, extra time taken, extra duration, etc)
- New Addition - "Realistic" Backlash:
	- Example: To cast fireball, one needs to first accumulate heat from the surrounding area and themselves (leading to potential hypothermia and frostbite as Backlash), then shape it (Using Pressure - Potentially with additional Backlash) and throw it.
	- This is achieved by: Individual Backlash Tables for each "School of Magic" (Heat/Cold, Pressure, Time, Gravity, etc). After every casting roll, one rolls on the appropriate Backlash table, adding for FP spend (keeping in mind temporary enhancements done to the spell like extra damage, extra range, extra time taken, etc)
	- In practice this is represented by **Backlash, Variable** in each Spell

## Mirror-Touched:
- These are mutations caused by exposed to areas of particularly weak veil, being in proximity to [[Veilborn Beings]], or even physically entering the [[The Mirror|Mirror]]. 
- The exact effect of these mutations can vary widely and range from minor cosmetic effects to powerful supernatural abilities.
- Mirror-Touched and Veilborn are by far the most unpredictable when it comes to their hidden abilities
- Being a Mirror-Touched generally is seen as a bad omen at least, but more often as reason to be put to the axe or flame.
## Veilborn:
