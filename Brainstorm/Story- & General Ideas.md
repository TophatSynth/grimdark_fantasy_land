- The demons from his dark materials
	- Tribe of Low-TL people bond with demons/shades/mirrorborn beings at birth
	- His dark materials by Philipp Pullman: Basic idea is that children get a deamon at young age. Like a real imaginary friend pretty much. During childhood the demon can shapeshift but when you turn adult, it settles into a permanent form. In the book they are always animals and somewhat represent their masters personality

- Kid raised by demons/shades/beasts/monsters (The Jungle Book)

- Moby Dick but it's a mammoth/dinosaur/giant beast

- Jumper (Uncontrollable, Reality/Mirror, Stress induced)

- Anti-Mutant vikings crusade against mirrorborn horrors but are also racist against any mirror-touched. Twist being that a mirror-touched helps them and they question their convictions

- There are two quite ancient "knightly" orders in the known world:
	- The first is the crumbling remains of a formerly powerful, respected, partially feared order. It is heavily inspired by witch hunters/inquisitors from Warhammer, lawful good paladins from dnd and @Scion's Knights Errant. They strife to purge the lands from taint and recover lost artifacts. They very much hate faction numero two

	- The second is inspired by the Predators and Mandalorians. They are also ancient. But instead of rejecting the Mirror, they embrace it with the necessary caution. Their main fortress is located partially inside the Mirror, the location having a particularly thin veil. The culture has learnt to distinguish (mostly successfully) between corrupting mutations and helpful ones, leading to planned exposure and a wide range of visual diversity and powers within the order. Regular purges of corrupted members are also necessary and accepted. The orders goal is not too far from the paladins, but for obvious reasons, the two are also mortal enemies.

- mutants/mirror touched are heavily hunted, shunned and even executed. The twist being that, in contrast to Warhammer, they are not automatically evil or possessed or whatever. They _are_ more prone to further mutations and becoming weirdness magnets though. So the reality is that many Mirror touched resent humanity and over time turn into the thing they were not in the beginning: Something to be afraid of

- Snow white:
	- The magic mirror is actually a normal one but a shape-shifting shade lives in it and drives the stepmother mad

- Pinocchio:
	- A father captures a peaceful [[Doppler]] from the Mirror and forces it to take on the looks and personality of his dead son (twist being that the son was killed by a veil touched after he gave her no choice but self defense)
