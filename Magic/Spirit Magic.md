## Overview
- Mostly (If not only) known and used in the wilderness of the Northern Expanse
- Has generally two Subcategories: **Spirit Communing** and **Spirit Absorption**
- Can generally **not** be learnt. One can or can not use it.
- It is important to note, that [[Elder Spirits]] and [[Spirit Fragments]] do **not** originate from the [[The Mirror|Mirror]], but the [[The Spirit Realm|Spirit Realm]] of reality
<br>
### Spirit Communing:
- Simply said, one invites nearby [[Elder Spirits]] to their camp.
- The less civilized/tainted/tamed the wilderness is, the more likely one or in rare instances, multiple spirits show up.
- Generally, being of elevated mind (Smoking mushrooms or herbs, Consuming strong liquor, etc) greatly increases the chance for contact
- The more (non-medium) people are present, the less likely a contact is to happen
- These [[Elder Spirits]] are a weird bunch. They appear mostly sentient, albeit not comparable to Humans. They generally couldn't care much less about worldly issues. They also have a very different sense of time and scale/distance to worldly beings. What most of them share is a great sadness, as the Spirits are slowly fading. Most times a Medium will at most get some vague hints or very open for interpretation statements and a long winded (yet often pleasant) philosophical debate.
<br>
### Spirit Absorption:
- [[Spirit Fragments]], in contrast to [[Elder Spirits]] are generally not viewed as sentient, at least of not in any way we can identify.
- This Practice sees the user absorb a wild spirit fragment into their body to gain specific benefits for a relatively short amount of time and with certain drawbacks.
- The known types of Spirit Fragments are:
	- Fire
	- Water
	- Death
	- Air
	- Rott
	- (More to come)
