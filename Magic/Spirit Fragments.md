# Overview
- Semi-sentient "minor" Spirits, often found in sites of wild nature, though they can be found almost anywhere near places or items pleasing to them
	- Only those with the `Spirit Sense` trait can see and sense the presence of Spirits
	- Spirits seem to favour places where [[The Veil]] is stronger, and likewise, shun [[Veil-Breaches]]. 
- They can be forced or lured into being bound with one's body or into a suitable prepared item
	- Provides a wildcard skill while within the user 
	- Can then be purged later, either by harmlessly releasing it or by expending the Spirit's power for the user's enhancement
	-  Further narrowing it down, only those with the `Spirit Weilder` trait can attempt to bind Spirits

# Luring and Binding
- Spirits can be attracted to a site and to manifest by engaging in a Luring Ritual
	- Each ritual takes 10 minutes, and can be made more appealing to Spirits by adding objects and, in more extreme cases, sacrifices related to their domain. 
	- At the end of the 10 minutes, the user rolls against their `Spirit Affinity` skill
		- Bonuses can be applied to the roll depending on the creativity of the ritual and the extent of preparation (value and relevance of objects etc), and penalties applied for features that are significantly out of the Spirit's domain — it is very unlikely to be able to attract Spirits of different domains at the same time — as well as the presence of mutations, corruption points, and veil-breaches/veil-thin areas
	- On a success, every 5 MoS means one Spirit of the relevant domain manifests nearby and within sight. On a failure, nothing happens, and the user is free to try again. 
	- One can, for example, perform a Luring Ritual in a river, juggling stones after gently setting leaves and other debris down to float away, while having lined the banks with sticks pointing along the direction of the wind. For ten minutes. Good luck. 
- Once this is done, the user must then perform a Binding Ritual. This can be done in two ways: 
	- Coaxing the Spirit: this represents gently approaching and encouraging the Spirit, showing that the user is not a threat and is a friendly entity, etc. It takes an hour per attempt, and at the end the user rolls against `Spirit Affinity + 5`. On a success, the Spirit finds them agreeable and binds to their body or item, depending on the user's intent. On a failure, the user expends 1 FP, but can try again freely. 
	- Forcing the Spirit: this represents trying to wrangle the Spirit into submission by physical or magical force, and is instantaneous. The user rolls against `Spirit Affinity`, contested against the Spirit's HT. Success means the Spirit is successfully subdued and binds to the user or the item. On a failure, _both_ the user and the Spirit lose 1 FP, and can try again.
