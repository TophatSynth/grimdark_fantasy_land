# Overview

There have been several attempts over the centuries by [[Loremasters]], magi and shamans alike to classify Spirits, but no consensus has been reached. Some theories postulate that they are a metamorphosed form of souls, evolved after years of existence; others think they are the work of powerful magicians from aeons past giving [[The Veil]] physical form. 

Whatever the case, these creatures, visible only to certain gifted individuals, seem to simply drift about aimlessly, gravitating towards sites and objects of similar affinity to its nature. They spend most of their time unseen, manifesting corporeally only occasionally, leading some to hypothesise the existence of a [[The Spirit Realm|Spirit realm]]. Most seem to be affable, or at least indifferent, to attempts at communication, and appear to remember the people they have interacted with, though the conveyance of intent and mood are somewhat limited by the lack of speech and facial expressions.

> This interaction between humans and Spirits can best be epitomised in the use of [[Spirit Magic]], where would-be users undergo long and complicated rituals to coax spirits into allowing them to harness their power. 

Of all the speculation surrounding Spirits, though, one thing seems to hold true and consistent: their nature is highly related to the Veil. As they age, spirits become more entwined in the veil, leading to fading in their physical form as their bodies become more translucent and manifest for shorter periods. Eventually, it is thought that they become part of the Veil permanently, though this too, is debated. It is clear, however, that they play a vital role in the separation — and protection — of this world from [[The Mirror & The Veil|the Mirror]].
