# [[Spirit Magic]]
- Mostly (If not only) known and used in the wilderness of the Northern Expanse
- Has generally two Subcategories: **Spirit Communing** and **Spirit Absorption**
- Can generally **not** be learnt. One can or can not use it.
- It is important to note, that [[Elder Spirits]] and [[Spirit Fragments]] do **not** originate from the [[The Mirror|Mirror]], but the [[The Spirit Realm|Spirit Realm]] of reality

## Veil Scarring/?Weaving (Somehow attached to the name)?:
- Leftover knowledge from aeons ago, before the [[Calamity]]. Extremely rare and dangerous these days
- Uses a modified version of our Vilenought-Magic System
- There will be **no** hardcore improvisation + improvisation. There will be however, temporary enhancements of spells (added damage, range, area, extra time taken, extra duration, etc)
- New Addition - "Realistic" Backlash:
	- Example: To cast fireball, one needs to first accumulate heat from the surrounding area and themselves (leading to potential hypothermia and frostbite as Backlash), then shape it (Using Pressure - Potentially with additional Backlash) and throw it.
	- This is achieved by: Individual Backlash Tables for each "School of Magic" (Heat/Cold, Pressure, Time, Gravity, etc). After every casting roll, one rolls on the appropriate Backlash table, adding for FP spend (keeping in mind temporary enhancements done to the spell like extra damage, extra range, extra time taken, etc)
	- In practice this is represented by **Backlash, Variable** in each Spell

## Mirror-Touched:
- These are mutations caused by exposed to areas of particularly weak veil, being in proximity to [[Veilborn Beings]], or even physically entering the [[The Mirror|Mirror]]. 
- The exact effect of these mutations can vary widely and range from minor cosmetic effects to powerful supernatural abilities.
- Mirror-Touched and Veilborn are by far the most unpredictable when it comes to their hidden abilities
- Being a Mirror-Touched generally is seen as a bad omen at least, but more often as reason to be put to the axe or flame.
## Veilborn:
