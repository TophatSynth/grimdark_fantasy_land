# Below are the (slightly cleaned/simplified up) mechanics from Vilenought:

## Basic Concept:

- New attribute: **Essence Attunement** (EA)
    - (IQ + HT)/2
    - 10 CP/lvl
    - Governs “Essence Reserve” (At default ER = EA, Can be bought up for 3 CP, up to 30% over EA, Can *not* be bought down)
    - Governs available “Weaving-Talent”-lvls
    - EA 10-11: “Weaving-Talent” 1, EA 12-13: “Weaving-Talent” 2, EA 14-15: “Weaving-Talent” 3 and so on
<br>
- **Essence Reserve** & HP:
    - Spells can only be paid for with ER or double the ER in HP, _not_ with regular FP!
    - ER recharges at 1/hour (Slow Recharge, -20%)
    - Recharge can be increased by meditation
    - Increase by: (Meditation-Level/10)*2
        - Minimum of 1
        - Round any decimals
<br>
- **Spells are Powers and Skills**:
	- Each Spell is build as a Power with [[Magic/Veil-Scarring (Or Essence Weaving)#Mandatory Enhancements & Limitations|mandatory Enhancements/Limitations]]
    - Each spell requires a casting roll against *Essence Weaving Skill* and, if relevant, a second roll **to attack** (Innate attack).
    - Essence Weaving is a VH skill that defaults to EA-based Thaumatology-5
    - A defaulted Essence Weaving cannot be higher than 15
    - Essence Weaving Rolls are modified by the Weaving-Talent level
<br>
- **Weaving Talents**:
    - Each Discipline is represented by a _Talent_ (Essentially replacing Magery)
    - Each Talent costs **5 CP/Level**
    - Talent lvl gives a bonus to Essence Weaving Rolls
    - Talent lvl gives a bonus on learning/creating associated Spells
    - Talent level is capped by EA
    - If a spell belongs to multiple aspects, then only the lowest Weaving Talent contributes.
<br>

## Weaving Empowerment:

- Cost: Pending
    
- Each discipline of magic has its own Weaving Empowerment
    
- All spells are **Alternative Abilities**, based on their governing Weaving Empowerment
    
- Cost of spells, excluding “Alternative Ability” can not exceed cost of Weaving Empowerment
    
- Learning an “Empowerment” unlocks **very** basic spells **for free** (List pending)
<br>
- **Temporary Preparation:**
    
    - Uses weaving empowerment **level** to determine which spells can be prepared.
    - Requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
    - Requires 1 hour of preparation/memorization
    - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
    - Once prepared, the weaving is treated as “known” and can be cast normally until "overwritten" 
        
- **Desperate Preperation:**
    
    - Uses **total CP** spend on (Instead of Level in) “Weaving Empowerment” to determine which spells can be prepared
    - Also requires a scroll or similar **detailed** written account in order to prepare a spell
    - Also requires 1 hour of preperation/memorization
    - Requires an EA-based Thaumatology Roll + Talent-Bonus
    - Once prepared, the weaver has a **single** casting of the spell ready
    - ?_Desperately_ prepared spells lead to increased “Essence Residue”-buildup in the weaver (raised by two (2) levels)?
        
- **Preparation-Slots:**
    
    - For each instance of Weaving Empowerment **one** (1) spell may be (desperately) prepared
        
    - Additional instances of Weaving Empowerment may be bought
        
    - Each prep-slot **only** allows preparation of spells from its type of magic
<br>
---
## Skill-roll to cast:

- Essence Weaving Roll (modified by corresponding Weaving-Talent)
- Spontaneous enhancements of known spells (Damage, Range, Duration, etc)
- Spontaneous modification of casting parameters (Time spend, Energy spend, Rituals used, etc)
- Penalties can be balanced out by spending more FP/HP and/or adjusting the casting parameters
	- See Spell modification - On the fly for details
- Spells can be modified in a more stable, prepared manner too
	- See Spell modification - Stable for details
<br>

## Acquiring new Spells:

- Only known Aspects can be used for spell construction
- Only when logically sound, can a new spell be constructed without outside help
- E.g. Fireball might need Matter, Heat and Pressure & Knowledge of “Create Fire” and “Gust” (Many routes might be feasible)
- Only exception: Learning from detailed written accounts or teachers
- Spell (Power) cost (after “Alternative Ability-Limitation”) can not exceed points in “Weaving Empowerment”
<br>

## Mandatory Enhancements & Limitations:
- **Requires Skill-Roll (Essence-Weaving)** [-10%],
	OR if Trait already requires Roll:
- Based on Different Attribute ((Essence Attunement (Essence Weaving Skill)), own roll [+20%]
- **Magical** [-10%],
- **Requires Gesture** [-10%],
- **Requires Word** [-10%],
- **Transcribable** [+5%],
- **Attracts Threats** (CR 9) [-10%],
- **Corrupting** (1 Corruption point/Energy spend) [-20%],

After all the above:

- **Costs ER/Double HP** (-10% per ER/2 HP, 1 ER/ 2 HP per 10 CP base cost) [Variable],

Finally _after all other calculations_ every spell gets **Alternative Ability** (Costs 1/5th)
<br>

**Corrupting**
- Essence Weaving pulls its primary source of energy (Essence) directly from the Mirror
- All energy pulled from the Mirror carries corruption (Fracture) with it into the Weaver
- Every point of essence used leaves a residue of Fracture in the Weaver
- At certain thresholds, the Fracture takes over and the Weaver must resist or mutate.
- It is mandatory for every weaving spell to have *Corrupting, -20%*
<br>

**[Radically Unstable Magery](https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Radically_Unstable_Magery)**
- Every spell is a great risk of catastrophic failure.
- It is mandatory for every spell-power to have *Radically unstable Magery, -10%*
- Probably overkill. Will Bench for now
- **On the Bench... For now!**
