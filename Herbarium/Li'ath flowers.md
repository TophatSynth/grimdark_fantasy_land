Ili'tha, "Burning glass" #ToDecide 
- These appear to be small orbs of glass, size ranging from marble to ping pong ball. The outer surface is translucent, revealing a bright orange liquid inside. 
- When the outer glass casing is broken, the liquid contained inside spontaneously combusts. Effects can range from lighting a small flame (think candle sized) to a grenade-scale explosion, depending on the specific Ili'tha. 
- The nature of the combustion can be controlled via the proportions of the Ili'tha's 3 main components: a composite containing sand and other minerals, sawdust and a solution of oil and the flower of the Li'ath plant
    - The Li'ath plant, also known as the "Firespout Petal", got its name from its flowering process, where the flower bud bursts into a tall "spout" of flame. The outer protective leaves, now burnt to ash, fall away, revealing an iridescent flower of swirling orange and reds. 
    - The composition of the sand mixture used determines the hardness of the outer glass shell. More sand creates a harder shell that cracks easily, while more minerals creates a shell that is slightly more elastic. 
    - The amount of sawdust used affects how long the flame burns for, as well as how strongly. 
    - Similarly, the more Li'ath solution used, the faster and stronger the initial burst of flame will be. 
- This makes them extremely versatile, capable of being used for a wide range of purposes from street lamps, simple firestarters, pocket stoves, to grenade and flashbangs.
