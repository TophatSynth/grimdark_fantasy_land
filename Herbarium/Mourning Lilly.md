When brewed, its petals offer solace in the form of a calming tea, though its taste is pronounced—sharp and almost metallic, lingering as a reminder of sorrow. Almost always available in temples of the [[The Mother of Sorrow|Mother Of Sorrow]], the tea is served to mourners as an offering of peace and to ease grieving hearts. The root, however, yields a far stronger, sleep-inducing draught potent enough to lull even the restless to sleep—or, when misused, to silence a life with its deadly embrace.
