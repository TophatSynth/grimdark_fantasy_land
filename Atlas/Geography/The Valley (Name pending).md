The Valley is a somewhat closed microcosm that represents [[The Country (Name pending)]] in almost all aspects and [[The Continent (Name pending)]] in at least the overarching ones. Wether it is also representative of [[The Planet (Name pending)]] as a whole remains to be seen, but currently there are no expeditions planned or ongoing that might uncover such secrets.

The valley stretches about X miles by Y miles and is dominated by the wilderness typical of its location, the southern fringes of [[The Northern Expanse]].

In the distant past the landscape was dotted by small towns, hamlets and farms that broke apart the sprawling forests covering the foothills of [[The Ironroot Mountains (Name placeholder)]] in the east, the [[Blackfrost Ridge (Name placeholder)]] in the north-west and [[The Dry Peaks (Name placeholder)]] in the south-west.

In these days, there are 4 settlements worth mentioning:
- [[Ironkeep (Name Placeholder)]] in the far south at the shores of the [[Rough Ocean (Name pending)]]
- [[Riverwell (Name placeholder)]] by the mouth of the River
- [[Mistbridge (Name Placeholder)]] in the Heartlands, surrounded by Enlightenment and fields of grain
- [[Wintermore (Name placeholder)]] high up in [[The Ironroot Mountains (Name placeholder)]], echoing with the sound of anvils in the forges and pickaxes deep down in the mines.
